/**
 * ## Baseline
 *
 * An instance of a [Run Manager](../../run-manager/) with a baseline strategy is included automatically in every instance of a [Scenario Manager](../), and is accessible from the Scenario Manager at `.baseline`.
 *
 * A baseline is defined as a run "advanced to the end" using just the model defaults. The baseline run is typically displayed in the project's UI as part of a run comparison table or chart.
 *
 * The `baseline` strategy looks for the most recent run named as 'Baseline' (or named as specified in the `baseline.runName` [configuration option of the Scenario Manager](../#configuration-options)) that is flagged as `saved` and not `trashed`. If the strategy cannot find such a run, it creates a new run and immediately executes a set of initialization operations. 
 *
 * Comparing against a baseline run is optional in a Scenario Manager; you can [configure](../#configuration-options) your Scenario Manager to not include one. See [more information](../#properties) on using `.baseline` within the Scenario Manager.
 *
 * See also: [additional information on run strategies](../../strategies/).
