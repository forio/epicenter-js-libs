/**
 * The `reuse-never` strategy always creates a new run for this end user irrespective of current state. This is equivalent to calling `F.service.Run.create()` from the [Run Service](../run-api-service/) every time. 
 * 
 * This strategy means that every time your end users refresh their browsers, they get a new run. 
 * 
 * This strategy can be useful for basic, single-page projects. This strategy is also useful for prototyping or project development: it creates a new run each time you refresh the page, and you can easily check the outputs of the model. However, typically you will use one of the other strategies for a production project.
