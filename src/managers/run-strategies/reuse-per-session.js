/**
 * The `reuse-per-session` strategy creates a new run when the current one is not in the browser cookie.
 * 
 * Using this strategy means that when end users navigate between pages in your project, or refresh their browsers, they will still be working with the same run.
 *
 * This strategy is useful if your project is structured such that immediately after a run is created, the model is executed completely (for example, a Vensim model that is stepped to the end as soon as it is created). In other words, you care whether you have a run, but as long as you have one, you are certain that this run is the one you are interested in. 
 * 
 * Specifically, the strategy is:
 *
 * * Check the `sessionKey` cookie.
 *     * This cookie is set by the [Run Manager](../run-manager/) and configurable through its options. 
 *     * If the cookie exists, use the run id stored there. 
 *     * If the cookie does not exist, create a new run for this end user.
