## Other Adapters

The Epicenter.js library is a set of services (adapters) and managers to help streamline your work with the underlying Epicenter APIs. 

In most cases when using Epicenter.js, you work with the [managers](../#concepts) directly.

However, you can also work with adapters (services) directly if you just want to communicate with the underlying [RESTful APIs](../../rest_apis/).

The most commonly used adapters include:

* [Auth Service](../generated/auth-api-service)
* [Channel Service](../generated/channel-service/)
* [Run Service](../generated/run-api-service/)
* [Variables Service](../generated/variables-api-service/)
* [World Adapter](../generated/world-api-adapter/)
* [Data Service](../generated/data-api-service/)

The other, less commonly used adapters include:

* [Asset Adapter](../generated/asset-api-adapter/)
* [State Adapter](../generated/state-api-adapter/)
* [User Adapter](../generated/user-api-adapter/)
* [Member Adapter](../generated/member-api-adapter/)
