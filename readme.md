# Epicenter JS Libraries

The Epicenter JS Libraries comprise a set of services (adapters) and managers to help streamline your work with the underlying Epicenter APIs.

If you are comfortable with JavaScript, the epicenter.js library is an easy way to connect your project's model, data, and user interface.

See the full [documentation](https://forio.com/epicenter/docs/public/api_adapters/) for more details.

## Getting started with development

To run locally
```
npm install
bower install

cd tests
bower install

grunt test  or grunt documentation
```
This will create a ```epicenter-edge.js``` file in ```dist/```. When you're happy with your changes do ```grunt production``` and make a pull-request to `master`.
